New Programmer Hackathon Ideas. I am new to hackathons. I am also new to coding. I thought it would be a great idea to have a section for new coders/programmers who are looking to participate in any potential hackathons to have clear and concise guidelines for participation. Trying to find out what a contribution was sounded almost ethereal before i started to do a bit of research. If the idea is to get programmers of all levels to participate then there should be concise instructions. Perhaps, this information can be added into your advertisment, or a file which speaks of participation guidelines. i believe this will greatly encourage those are just starting out on their coding journey.
